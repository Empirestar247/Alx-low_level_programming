# Search Algorithms in C

## Overview

This repository contains C implementations of two commonly used search algorithms: linear search and binary search. It also provides a brief explanation of what search algorithms are and when to choose the appropriate one based on your needs.

## What is a Search Algorithm?

A search algorithm is a method or procedure used to find a specific item or value within a collection of data. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications, including data retrieval, database querying, and information retrieval.

## Linear Search

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until it finds the target element or exhausts the entire list. It is suitable for unsorted lists and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm suitable for sorted lists or arrays. It divides the list in half repeatedly and compares the target value with the middle element until the element is found or the search range is empty. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly faster for large datasets compared to linear search.

## Choosing the Best Search Algorithm

The choice between linear search and binary search depends on the characteristics of the data and your specific needs:

- **Linear Search**: Use linear search when the data is unsorted or when the overhead of sorting is not justified. Linear search is simple to implement and works well for small datasets.

- **Binary Search**: Choose binary search when the data is sorted, as it offers a substantial speedup compared to linear search for larger datasets. However, keep in mind that you need to maintain the data in a sorted order.

## Repository Structure

- `linear_search.c`: Contains the C implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- `binary_search.c`: Contains the C implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for using the code.

## Usage

To use the search algorithms provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-algorithms-c.git


2. Compile the desired search algorithm (e.g., linear search):


   gcc linear_search.c -o linear_search


3. Run the compiled program, providing the necessary input:

   ```
   ./linear_search
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the target value and data elements.
